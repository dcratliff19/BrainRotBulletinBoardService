# BrainRotBBS - The Terminal That Fries Your Synapses

**Welcome to the dankest corner of the internet, where your brain cells go to yeet themselves into the void.** BrainRotBBS is a PeerJS-powered, xterm.js-driven, neon-soaked bulletin board system that’s less about “productivity” and more about maximum chaos. Think Skibidi Toilet meets a CRT glitch fever dream, minus the nerdy Vim stuff (RIP, you were too pure). If you’re here, your rizz levels are already too high—or too low. Either way, you’re toast.

## What the Heck Is This?

This ain’t your grandma’s BBS. It’s a terminal where you:
- Chat with peers like a deranged whisper gremlin.
- Scream into the ether with broadcasts that echo in Ohio.
- Edit docs and sayings that make zero sense but 100% rot.
- Play mini-games, infect buddies with chaos, and portal into glitch dimensions.
- Scroll back through command history with arrow keys because retyping is for normies.

Built with xterm.js, PeerJS, and a whole lotta “what the fuck,” it’s the digital equivalent of a dumpster fire lit by neon glowsticks.

## Installation - Yeet It Onto Your Machine

1. **Grab the Code**: Snag this HTML file like it’s the last Skibidi meme on earth. Copy-paste it into `brainrotbbs.html` or whatever your rotted brain calls it.
2. **Open It**: Drag that bad boy into a browser (Chrome, Firefox, anything not IE—RIP). No server needed, just client-side madness.
3. **Internet**: Stay online—PeerJS needs the cloud to connect your fellow rotters.
4. **Profit**: Watch your screen glow green and your sanity yeet out the window.

No npm, no bullshit—just raw HTML and JS served straight from the CDN gods.

## Usage - How to Rot Properly

1. **Login**: Type a username when it yells "Spill ur username, brain rotter:"—go wild, nobody’s judging (except me, it’s “anonymous” if you blank).
2. **Commands**: Smash these into the terminal like a caffeinated chaos goblin:
   - `/connect <peer>`: Link up with another rotter’s PeerJS ID (check your ID after login).
   - `/chat <peer> <message>`: Whisper some unhinged nonsense.
   - `/broadcast <message>`: Yell so loud even Ohio hears it.
   - `/edit`: Start a new brain rot doc.
   - `/open <doc number>`: Edit an old pile of rot.
   - `/listdocs`: Peek at your saved chaos.
   - `/share <doc number> <peer>`: Spread the rot like a virus.
   - `/skibidi`: Drop a meme and score +10 rot points.
   - `/meme`: More meme chaos, no questions asked.
   - `/chaos`: Toggle typing insanity (good luck).
   - `/portal`: Glitch into a green dimension for 5 seconds.
   - `/infect <peer>`: Send 10 seconds of chaos to a buddy.
   - `/game`: Play "Rot or Not" (+50 points if you guess right).
   - `/secret`: Unlock the Rizz Code (42069, baby).
   - `/sayings`: List your editable rot sayings.
   - `/edit-saying <index> <new-saying>`: Tweak the meme pool.
   - `/help`: See this list (↑/↓ for history).
3. **History**: Use **Up/Down arrows** to scroll through past commands—re-rot without the sweat.
